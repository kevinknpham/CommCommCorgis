Comm Comm Corgis is inspired by the legendary Club Penguin but with corgis and the locations inspired by the University of Washington Seattle campus!

Comm Comm Corgis is intended to recreate the Comm Comm (Commuter Commons) experience for UW (University of Washington) students who are currently unable to fully engage with the UW Seattle community due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
